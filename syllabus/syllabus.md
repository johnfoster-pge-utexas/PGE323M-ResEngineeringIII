**Class Location:** CPE 3.114  
**Class Time:** T-Th 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM  
**Office Hours:** T-Th 9:45 AM - 10:45 AM and by appointment   


**Course Website:** [https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1266190](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1266190) 

**Course Development Environment:** <a href="https://spindletop.pge.utexas.edu" target="_blank">spindletop.pge.utexas.edu</a>

**Course Description**: Mathematical equations governing fluid flow in reservoirs; numerical methods to solve the equations; numerical reservoir simulation; treatment of wells; history matching; a simulation project performed using a commercial simulator. Restricted to students admitted to major sequence in geosystems engineering and hydrogeology or petroleum engineering. 


**Prerequisites:** Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering 323L

**Book:** Most of the reservoir simulation textbooks are out-dated and/or are geared towards graduate students. There are several books that would make a good reference which are included below.  

Additionally, Dr. Balhoff has a manuscript for a textbook he is writing that may be downloaded from Canvas and used as a reference.
